# Pricing Prediction Summary

To summarize this process of predicting a better pricing model, we will move step by step starting from the Problem Statement, to the algorithms used and then finishing with the price recommendation and also potential future work. To preface this document, broadly speaking it is regarding a skiing resort called Big Mountain, which has business executives looking to re-evaluate their pricing model.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement part of this process is to simply get an understanding and summary of the initial problem that we are trying to solve. It is here where we clarify what exactly we are trying to do. In particular, the issue was decided to be that the ticket prices are to be adjusted. Whether the ticket prices will be increased depends on whether or no costs are cut by removing assets, or assets are added to justify a ticket price increase. These assets are the features of the data that will be used to predict the ticket prices, and success is dependent on predicting a better pricing model for the tickets.
